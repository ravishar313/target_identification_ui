# AI Workflow Assistant: Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to create an intelligent workflow assistant chat interface that helps users navigate through various workflows in the application, with initial implementation for the Lead Identification workflow.

## Requirements

- Right sidebar chat interface
- LLM integration via OpenRouter API
- Action execution capability
- Data-aware question answering
- Workflow navigation assistance
- Extensible architecture for future workflows

## System Architecture

### 1. State Management

We'll use **Zustand** for state management due to its:
- Simplicity and minimal boilerplate
- Easy integration with React
- Ability to create separate stores for different concerns
- Support for middleware and actions

### 2. Agent System

#### Core Agents

1. **Context Agent**
   - Maintains awareness of current workflow, step, and visible data
   - Provides relevant context to other agents

2. **Data Agent**
   - Fetches data relevant to user queries
   - Accesses and filters workflow-specific data
   - Provides data summaries for question answering

3. **Action Agent**
   - Executes UI actions (navigation, filtering, sorting)
   - Performs workflow-specific operations
   - Translates natural language commands to UI actions

4. **Planning Agent**
   - Determines sequence of operations needed
   - Coordinates other agents
   - Handles multi-step requests

5. **Integration Agent**
   - Communicates with LLM via OpenRouter API
   - Processes responses and formats them for display
   - Handles streaming responses

### 3. Component Structure

```
/src
  /components
    /assistant
      AssistantSidebar.jsx       # Main container component
      AssistantChat.jsx          # Chat UI component
      AssistantToggle.jsx        # Button to show/hide assistant
      /agents
        ContextAgent.js          # Context awareness
        DataAgent.js             # Data retrieval
        ActionAgent.js           # Action execution
        PlanningAgent.js         # Request planning
        IntegrationAgent.js      # LLM integration
      /store
        assistantStore.js        # Main Zustand store
        contextStore.js          # Context tracking store
        chatStore.js             # Chat history store
```

### 4. Data Context Hierarchy

We'll implement a hierarchical context structure:

```
{
  workflow: 'lead-identification',
  step: 'ligand-design',
  section: 'grid-view',
  data: {
    leads: [...],
    filters: {...},
    sortBy: '...',
    // Other relevant data
  },
  uiState: {
    // UI-specific state
  }
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: State Management & Context Awareness

1. Create Zustand stores:
   - Main assistant store
   - Context store
   - Chat history store

2. Implement context tracking system:
   - Track current workflow
   - Track current step
   - Track active sections
   - Track available data

3. Create provider components and hooks for accessing the stores

### Phase 2: Chat UI Components

1. Create AssistantSidebar component:
   - Sliding panel from right side
   - Toggle button for show/hide
   - Header with title and controls

2. Create AssistantChat component:
   - Message display area
   - Input field with send button
   - Auto-scrolling message list
   - Loading indicators
   - Message formatting

### Phase 3: Agent Implementation

1. Implement Integration Agent:
   - OpenRouter API connection
   - Message handling
   - Response streaming

2. Implement Context Agent:
   - Workflow awareness
   - Step awareness
   - Data context extraction

3. Implement Data Agent:
   - Query parsing
   - Data retrieval functions
   - Data transformation for responses

4. Implement Action Agent:
   - UI action mapping
   - Action execution
   - Action confirmation

5. Implement Planning Agent:
   - Query analysis
   - Task decomposition
   - Agent coordination

### Phase 4: Workflow-Specific Implementations

1. Lead Identification Workflow:
   - Define step-specific actions
   - Define data schema for each step
   - Create step-specific response templates

2. Test with sample scenarios:
   - Navigation between steps
   - Data queries
   - Action requests
   - Multi-step operations

### Phase 5: Extension Framework

1. Create extension points for new workflows:
   - Workflow registration system
   - Step registration system
   - Action registration system

2. Document how to add support for new workflows

## Technical Considerations

### State Updates

- Use React's useEffect to update context when workflow/step changes
- Set up listeners for data changes
- Implement middleware for logging state changes

### Agent Communication

- Define clear interfaces between agents
- Use async/await for sequential operations
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations

### Security Considerations

- Sanitize user input before processing
- Limit actions to safe operations
- Implement permission checks for sensitive actions

### Performance Optimization

- Implement debouncing for rapid user input
- Use memoization for expensive computations
- Optimize rendering with React.memo where appropriate

## User Experience

- Show thinking/processing states visually
- Provide clear feedback for actions taken
- Allow cancellation of long-running operations
- Support message history and conversation context

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-turn reasoning with memory
- Proactive suggestions based on user activity
- Integration with other modules
- Personalization based on user preferences
